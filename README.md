[Donkey IDE](http://donkey.davidma.cn).

Donkey IDE is an online IDE and debugger for International Baccalaureate (IB) Computer Science's Pseudocode standard. It features a grammar parser, code emitter and virtual machine runtime designed specifically for IB Pseudocode, forming a fully-fledged online IDE that provides extensive support for the IB Pseudocode language and its data structures.

In addition to serving as a code executer, the Donkey IDE features a debugger that allows the user to trace through her code with breakpoints for better understanding of IB-issued code and an easier debugging process. The output of the program and the debugger are in separate locations to simplify the user interface.
