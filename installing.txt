This file contains instructions for the IB examiner to setup and test the "Donkey IDE" project.

The submitted project files include the "bundle.js" file, which is the built code for the project. You should be able to use the project by simply opening "index.html" in a browser. However, if you would like to build the project from its source code, follow the following instructions.

Build instructions:
1. Install the Node.js runtime: https://nodejs.org. This should also install the "npm" package manager.
2. Move into the project directory with the `cd` command.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies for the project.
4. Run `npm run build` to build the source code. This results in a new "bundle.js" file in the project directory.
5. Open "index.html" in a browser to access the project.
