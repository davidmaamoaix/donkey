============

Donkey IDE is my project for IB Computer Science Internal Assessment, and I will need a lot of feedbacks to write my report documents, so issue/suggestions are welcome (open an issue on the GitHub page `here <https://github.com/davidmaamoaix/donkey>`_)!

If you want to add a certain feature or fix a bug, feel free to make a pull request on GitHub. However, since this IDE targets the IB Pseudocode standard, no language/syntax extension features will be accepted (unless it is one that is in the IB standard but not currently implemented, and you feel that there is no reason not to implement it).

Please adhere to the current code style when contributing.
